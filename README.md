# FUTURE_CS_01
Web Application Security Assessment using OWASP Top 10 - vulnerability identification, mapping, and basic impact analysis.

# FUTURE_CS_01 – Web Application Security Assessment

## Project Overview
This task focuses on performing a basic web application security assessment.
The objective was to identify vulnerabilities, test authentication behavior,
and map findings to OWASP Top 10 risks.

## Scope of Testing
- Login functionality testing
- Weak credential testing
- Input validation checks
- Authentication behavior analysis

## Key Findings
- Login accepted weak credentials (e.g., hacked123)
- Improper authentication controls observed
- Potential risk of unauthorized access

## OWASP Top 10 Mapping
- A2: Broken Authentication
- A7: Identification and Authentication Failures

## Tools Used
- Manual testing
- Browser developer tools
- Basic security analysis techniques

## Outcome
The assessment highlighted authentication weaknesses and security gaps
that could lead to unauthorized access if not fixed.

## Learning Outcome
- Understanding OWASP Top 10
- Mapping real findings to security risks
- Basic vulnerability documentation
